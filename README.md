üõ†Ô∏è Working Process
User Authentication

Users must sign up/sign in.
The sessionStorage stores the user ID for authentication.
Adding a Task

Users input a title, body, and due date.
The frontend sends a POST request to /api/v2/addTask.
The task is saved in MongoDB, linked to the user.
Fetching Tasks

When the user logs in, a GET request to /api/v2/getTasks/:id fetches tasks.
Tasks are displayed using React state (useState).
Deleting a Task

Clicking delete sends a DELETE request to /api/v2/deleteTask/:id.
The backend removes the task from the database and the user‚Äôs task list.
Reordering Tasks (Drag & Drop)

Users can reorder tasks using React DnD.
The new order is stored in React state.
Displaying Time in IST

The backend formats the due date to Indian Standard Time (IST) before saving.
The frontend also uses Moment.js for displaying the correct timezone.
